# Given an SRT, find any unmarked silent intervals and add them to the SRT
# It also does some other preprocessing steps:
#     * cleaning up quotation symbols because those cause trouble for Praat
#     * remove consecutive blank lines
#     * make the interval numbers incremently increase from 1
#     * find timing errors
#     * remove SRT intervals that are empty
